Description: Implementations for two different Bayesian models of differential co-expression. scdeco.cop() fits the bivariate Gaussian copula model from Zichen Ma, Shannon W. Davis, Yen-Yi Ho (2023) <doi:10.1111/biom.13701>, while scdeco.pg() fits the bivariate Poisson-Gamma model from Zhen Yang, Yen-Yi Ho (2022) <doi:10.1111/biom.13457>.
